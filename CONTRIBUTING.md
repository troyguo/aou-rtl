# Contributing to AOU-RTL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AXI-over-UCIe Bridge RTL project!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tenstorrent/aou-rtl/issues):

1. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Provide a clear title and description
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Specify your environment (simulator version, OS, etc.)
5. Include relevant log files or error messages

### Submitting Changes

We welcome bug fixes, improvements, and new features via Pull Requests:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main`
2. **Name your branch** using one of the required prefixes:
   - `feature/` -- new functionality (e.g., `feature/add-fdi-support`)
   - `bugfix/` -- bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/fix-clock-gating`)
   - `hotfix/` -- critical fixes (e.g., `hotfix/critical-reset`)
   - `chore/` -- maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-ci`)

   A CI check ([`.github/workflows/branch-name-check.yaml`](.github/workflows/branch-name-check.yaml))
   enforces this convention; PRs from branches that do not match will
   fail the check.
3. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below
4. **Test your changes** using the verification testbench
5. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
6. **Submit a Pull Request** with a detailed description of your changes

- Pull requests are reviewed on a **weekly basis**
- Maintainers will provide feedback or request changes
